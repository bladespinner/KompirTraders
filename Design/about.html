						<h3>
						The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial Solanum tuberosum 
						of the Solanaceae family (also known as the nightshades). The word may refer 
						to the plant itself as well as the edible tuber. In the region of the Andes, 
						there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were 
						introduced outside the Andes region four centuries ago, and have become an integral 
						part of much of the world's cuisine. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, 
						following rice, wheat and maize. Long-term storage of potatoes requires specialised 
						care in cold warehouses.Wild potato species occur throughout the Americas, from the United States 
						to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently 
						in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild 
						species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme
						northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the Solanum brevicaule complex), where they were domesticated
						7,000–10,000 years ago.Following centuries of selective breeding, there are now over a thousand different
						types of potatoes.Of these subspecies, a variety that at one point grew in the Chiloe Archipelago 
						(the potato's south-central Chilean sub-center of origin) left its germplasm on over 99% of the
						cultivated potatoes worldwide.
